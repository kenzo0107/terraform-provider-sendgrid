  Provides a subuser resource.
  Subusers help you segment your email sending and API activity. You assign permissions and credit limits when you create the subuser. We recommend creating subusers for each of the different types of emails you send - one subuser for transactional emails, and another for marketing emails. Breaking your sending up this way allows you to get separate statistics for each type of email you send.
