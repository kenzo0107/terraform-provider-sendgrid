# sendgrid_reverse_dns (Resource)

Provides reverseDNS resource.

Reverse DNS (formerly IP Whitelabel) allows mailbox providers to verify the sender of an email by performing a reverse DNS lookup upon receipt of the emails you send.

Reverse DNS is available for [dedicated IP addresses](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/dedicated-ip-addresses/) only.

When setting up reverse DNS, Twilio SendGrid will provide an A Record (address record) for you to add to your DNS records. The A Record maps your sending domain to a dedicated Twilio SendGrid IP address.

A Reverse DNS consists of a subdomain and domain that will be used to generate a reverse DNS record for a given IP address. Once Twilio SendGrid has verified that the appropriate A record for the IP address has been created, the appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP address is generated.

You can also manage your reverse DNS settings in the [Sender Authentication setion of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth).

For more about Reverse DNS, see ["How to set up reverse DNS"](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-reverse-dns/) in the Twilio SendGrid documentation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_reverse_dns" "example" {
  ip        = "127.0.0.1"
  domain    = "example.com"
  subdomain = "dummy"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) The root, or sending, domain.
- `ip` (String) The IP address that this Reverse DNS was created for.

### Optional

- `subdomain` (String) The subdomain created for this reverse DNS. This is where the rDNS record points.

### Read-Only

- `a_record` (Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--a_record))
- `id` (String) The ID of the Reverse DNS.
- `last_validation_attempt` (Number) A Unix epoch timestamp representing the last time of a validation attempt.
- `legacy` (Boolean) Indicates if this Reverse DNS was created using the legacy whitelabel tool. If it is a legacy whitelabel, it will still function, but you'll need to create a new Reverse DNS if you need to update it.
- `rdns` (String) The reverse DNS record for the IP address. This points to the Reverse DNS subdomain.
- `users` (Attributes Set) The users who are able to send mail from the IP address. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--users))
- `valid` (Boolean) Indicates if this is a valid Reverse DNS.

<a id="nestedatt--a_record"></a>
### Nested Schema for `a_record`

Read-Only:

- `data` (String)
- `host` (String)
- `type` (String)
- `valid` (Boolean)


<a id="nestedatt--users"></a>
### Nested Schema for `users`

Read-Only:

- `user_id` (Number) The ID of a user who can send mail from the IP address.
- `username` (String) The username of a user who can send mail from the IP address.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
