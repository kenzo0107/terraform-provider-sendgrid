## Schema

### Required

- `integration_id` (String) An ID that matches a certificate to a specific IdP integration. This is the id returned by the "Get All SSO Integrations" endpoint.
- `public_certificate` (String) This public certificate allows SendGrid to verify that SAML requests it receives are signed by an IdP that it recognizes.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) A unique ID assigned to the certificate by SendGrid.
- `not_after` (Number) A unix timestamp (e.g., 1603915954) that indicates the time after which the certificate is no longer valid.
- `not_before` (Number) A unix timestamp (e.g., 1603915954) that indicates the time before which the certificate is not valid.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
% terraform import sendgrid_sso_certificate.example <certificate id>
```
