  Provides a subuser resource.
  Subusers help you segment your email sending and API activity. You assign permissions and credit limits when you create the subuser. We recommend creating subusers for each of the different types of emails you send - one subuser for transactional emails, and another for marketing emails. Breaking your sending up this way allows you to get separate statistics for each type of email you send.
  For more detailed information, please see the SendGrid documentation https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys.

# sendgrid_subuser (Resource)

Provides a subuser resource.

Subusers help you segment your email sending and API activity. You assign permissions and credit limits when you create the subuser. We recommend creating subusers for each of the different types of emails you send - one subuser for transactional emails, and another for marketing emails. Breaking your sending up this way allows you to get separate statistics for each type of email you send.

For more detailed information, please see the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_subuser" "example" {
  username            = "dummy"
  email               = "dummy@example.com"
  password_wo         = "dummydummy1!"
  password_wo_version = 1
  ips                 = ["1.1.1.2"]
}
```

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password of the subuser. NOTE: The password will only be saved in the tfstate during the execution of the creation.
- `password_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The write-only password of the subuser. NOTE: password_wo is write-only and cannot be saved in the tfstate.
