## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) Teammate's email

For more detailed information, please see the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/teammate-permissions#persona-scopes)

The following Scopes are set automatically by SendGrid, so they cannot be set manually:`2fa_exempt`, `2fa_required`, `sender_verification_exempt`, `sender_verification_eligible`. A teammate remains in a pending state until the invitation is accepted, during which scopes cannot be modified.

- `username` (String) Teammate's username

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```
